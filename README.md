# Pokemon-Database-Project
A repository of resources used for my semester project in my Database Management Systems class.

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a relational database using Oracle SQL of whatever information I wanted. 
Since Pokemon was a pillar of my childhood, I figured it was a great resource to use.
